/**
 * Route RBAC Enforcement Tests
 *
 * Verifies that every mutating [orgSlug] API route enforces the same role
 * permissions the server actions already do (via checkPermission /
 * requireRoutePermission), and that the underlying permission mapping
 * produces the intended allow/deny decisions for each role.
 *
 * Part 1 (static guard): every route file below must reference
 * requireRoutePermission or checkPermission. This is the regression net —
 * a new mutating route that forgets the gate fails this test. Keep the
 * list in sync when routes are added or removed.
 *
 * Part 2 (behavioral): exercises checkPermission directly for the mapping
 * decisions that matter most (template delete, test-email send, and the
 * marketing-role workflow boundary).
