              SendGrid rents you a sending API. Wraps sets up Amazon SES in your
              own AWS account and then runs it for you.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 max-w-2xl text-muted-foreground">
              Most teams choose SendGrid because they do not want to deal with
              SES. That is a fair reason, and it is the one Wraps removes. One
              command deploys the whole SES surface into your account, without
              touching anything already there.

              Then the control plane runs it: bounce and complaint rates swept
              hourly against AWS's own review and pause lines, suppression you
              can browse and clear, deliverability and blacklist audits on
              demand, and a row in the log for every message you send.

                      Every hour Wraps reads your bounce and complaint rates and
                      draws them against AWS's own lines. AWS can place an
                      account under review above a 5% bounce rate and can pause
                      sending at 10%; for complaints those lines are 0.1% and
                      0.5%. Owners and admins get told, deduped to once per
                      account per day.
