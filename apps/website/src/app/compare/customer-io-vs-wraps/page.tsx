              Customer.io is a marketing automation platform. You rent it, you
              pay per contact, and they host everything. Wraps puts the same
              surface on Amazon SES in your own AWS account: one command sets it
              all up, then one control plane runs it day to day.

              Both send lifecycle email from workflows, broadcasts, segments,
              and templates. The difference is who operates the sending
              infrastructure, and what it costs when your list grows.
