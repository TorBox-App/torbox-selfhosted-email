            <p className="mb-4 max-w-2xl text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              Postmark has spent more than a decade on one job: getting
              transactional email into the inbox. That reputation is real, and
              it is what the premium buys. If inbox placement is the thing
              keeping you up, they have earned the money.
            </p>
            <p className="max-w-2xl text-lg">
              Wraps takes the other route. One command sets up the whole Amazon
              SES surface in your own AWS account, and the Wraps control plane
              runs it day to day &mdash; bounce and complaint rates watched
              against AWS&apos;s own lines, suppression you can browse,
              deliverability audits, a log of every message. Everything Amazon
              SES needs, including operations.

              AWS can place an account under review above a 5% bounce rate and
              can pause sending at 10%; for complaints the lines are 0.1% and
              0.5%. Both the hourly sweep and the deployed alarms sit below
              those numbers on purpose. Postmark&apos;s answer is that you never
              look at any of this, and for a lot of teams that is the right
              answer. Ours is that you can see the same numbers on your own
              infrastructure, and hear about a problem while it is still small.

              The Architectural Difference
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
              Postmark is a fully managed SaaS. Your emails send from
              Postmark&apos;s shared IP pools, your data lives on their servers,
              and the reputation those IPs carry is pooled across every customer
              on them. That pooled reputation is the product, and it is well
              kept. Wraps inverts the arrangement: the sending infrastructure
              sits in your AWS account and the reputation is yours alone.

              Wraps is the control plane. AWS SES is the data plane. Be precise
              about where the split falls: SES sending and the per-message
              delivery history sit in your account. Contacts, templates,
              broadcasts and workflow state sit in Wraps&apos; Postgres, along
              with a row per message carrying the recipient address, subject,
              sender, template variables, and delivery and open timestamps. If
              your security review needs recipient addresses never to leave your
              own account, that is the limit to weigh.
