              In September 2026 a team moving about 3,000 lifecycle emails a
              month off shared SMTP wrote their options up in public. They
              costed Amazon SES at roughly $0.30 a month against Resend at $20,
              called SES &ldquo;cheapest by far&rdquo; — and recommended Resend
              anyway. Their SES row, in full:

              A 66&times; price difference, AWS credentials already sitting on
              the dev machine, and the two clauses after that semicolon were

              trade this page is about. Here is what Wraps does about each of
              those clauses — and what it does not.

                  else selling you software — it is an AWS decision made from
                  your own account, and some requests are refused. What the CLI
                  does is detect sandbox at the end of a deploy, explain what it
                  means, and point you at the request, so it is not something
                  you discover from a failed send. That constraint applies to
                  every approach that sends from an account you own.

                  both rates against the lines Amazon enforces — review at 5%
                  bounce and 0.1% complaint, sending paused at 10% and 0.5% —
                  and sweeps the account hourly so a drift shows up before the

                Wraps platform tiers: Free ($0/mo), Pro ($29/mo), Business
                ($199/mo) — priced on AWS accounts, dashboard history, and
                governance features, not send volume. All tiers include

                Worth knowing on Resend: exceeding your tier auto-bills at
                $0.65-0.90/1K. Getting Scale features at 100K costs $90/mo (the
                $35 Pro tier skips SSO and caps domains at 10). CC/BCC count as
                separate emails. Marketing contacts billed separately ($40/mo
                for 5K contacts).
              </p>
              <p>
                At 50K/mo the two are priced about the same, so price is not the
                reason to move. What changes is who sets the account up, who
                watches it, and where the events live: with Wraps they land in
                your own DynamoDB at the retention you choose, against
                Resend&apos;s 30-day cap. (Wraps dashboard history runs 30 days
                to 1 year depending on plan; the underlying events are always
