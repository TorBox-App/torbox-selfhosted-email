              sets the infrastructure up in your AWS account. The control plane

              place an account under review above a 5% bounce rate and can pause
              sending at 10%, and for complaints the equivalent lines are 0.1%
              and 0.5%. The alarms Wraps deploys sit deliberately below them —
              bounce warns at 2% and goes critical at 4%, complaints warn at
              0.05% and go critical at 0.08% — so a drift reaches you by email
              or webhook, in Slack, Discord or PagerDuty, while there is still
              room to fix it. Raw SES publishes the numbers. Wraps draws the gap
              against them, every hour, without anyone opening CloudWatch.

              You move your DNS, warm a new reputation, rewrite your sending
              code, pay a per-email markup, and keep nothing if you leave.

                  create and can revoke, assumed for an hour at a time. No AWS

                  your own deploy config. Contacts, templates, broadcasts,
                  workflow state and a row per message — recipient, subject,

              One command deploys the whole SES surface to your AWS account: SES
              configuration, domain identity, suppression, the event pipeline,
              rate monitoring and HTTPS open and click tracking. The free plan
              needs no card.

                <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  The CLI walks through connecting your AWS account, verifying
                  the domain, creating DNS records and deploying. If you already
                  have SES set up, it detects your existing domain verification
                  and adds the supporting infrastructure on top: no DNS changes,
                  no reputation risk.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  If the account is still in the SES sandbox, init says so at
                  the end, explains what it means, and links the production
                  access request in your console. AWS decides that one. Nobody
                  selling software can decide it for you.
