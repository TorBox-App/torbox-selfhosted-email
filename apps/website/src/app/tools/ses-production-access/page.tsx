    question: "Why did AWS deny my SES production access request?",
    answer:
      "The request form asks for an email type, a website and contact addresses, so reviewers have to infer your sending practices from very little. Denials cluster into four gaps: the account has verified a single email address rather than a domain; the website does not explain the mail; nothing says how recipients ended up on the list; and there is no bounce or complaint handling. The standard refusal — that your use of Amazon SES could have a negative impact on our service — names none of them, which is why it feels arbitrary.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I write in an SES production access request?",
    answer:
      "Answer the four questions the form never asks, in plain sentences: what you send and what triggers it, how an address gets onto your list, roughly how many emails you expect to send, and what happens to a bounce or a complaint. Name your unsubscribe mechanism. Keep it short and specific — a paragraph of detail a reviewer can check against your site beats a page of intent.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I appeal an SES production access denial?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A denial is not final. AWS delivers the decision through a Support Center case tied to your request, and that case is where you reply with more detail. Fix the gap first — verify the domain, put a signup form on the site, set up bounce handling — then reply on the existing case. Opening a fresh request instead throws away the context the reviewer already has.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a verified domain for SES production access?",
    answer:
      "You are not formally required to have one, but a request from an account that has verified only a single email address gives the reviewer nothing to check, and it is the most common reason a request stalls. Verify the sending domain, enable DKIM and wait for the status to leave Pending, and publish SPF and DMARC records before you submit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this tool send my denial text anywhere?",
    answer:
      "No. The matching runs in your browser with plain keyword rules, and the request text is assembled from fixed templates in the same place. There is no account, no upload, no model call, and no server involved. Deterministic templates are the point: this output goes to AWS support under your name, so the same answers always produce the same words.",
