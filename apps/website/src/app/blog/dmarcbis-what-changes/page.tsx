              DMARC has always needed to answer one question before it can do
              anything else: what is the Organizational Domain for this name?
              That answer decides which record applies and whether an
              authenticated identifier is aligned. Under RFC 7489 the answer
              came from a Public Suffix List. RFC 9989 Section 4.10 explains, at
              some length, why that was a problem:

                on the Mail Receiver. To guard against such abuse of the DNS, a
                shortcut is built into the process so that Author Domains with
                more than eight labels do not result in more than eight DNS
                queries. Observed data at the time of publication showed that

              Eight is a ceiling, not a cost. A normal two- or three-label
              domain that publishes its own record resolves in one query and
              stops. Nobody is paying eight lookups per message.

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Section 4.10 opens by naming two distinct uses for the walk. The
              first is the obvious one: policy discovery (Section 4.10.1), when
              the Author Domain has no record of its own and the receiver needs
              to find the one it inherits from. The second is the one people
              forget &mdash; identifier alignment evaluation (Section 4.10.2),
              deciding whether the SPF- or DKIM-authenticated identifier and the
              Author Domain share an Organizational Domain. A receiver may run
              the walk several times while evaluating a single message.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Once the walk has collected records, Section 4.10.2 picks the
              Organizational Domain by going from the longest name to the
              shortest. A record with{" "}
              <code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5">psd=n</code> wins
              immediately &mdash; that name is the Organizational Domain, stop
              looking. A record other than the starting point carrying{" "}
              <code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5">psd=y</code>{" "}
              means the Organizational Domain is the domain one label below it.
              Failing both, it is the record found at the name with the fewest
              labels. If the process determines nothing at all, the initial
              target domain is the Organizational Domain.

                an escape hatch: per Section 4.7, it declares the domain is not
                a PSD and is the Organizational Domain for itself and its
                subdomains. A large organization whose boundary the PSL got

                    Step 2 of the walk is explicit: if multiple DMARC Policy
                    Records are returned for a single target, they are all
                    discarded. Not &ldquo;the first one wins&rdquo;, not
                    &ldquo;merge them&rdquo; &mdash; discarded. And per Section
                    4.10.1, if the walk finds no record, Mail Receivers MUST NOT
                    apply the DMARC mechanism to the message. A duplicated TXT
                    record left behind by a migration silently turns your policy

              5.1.4 notes that if the Organizational Domain differs from the
              Author Domain, a record also needs to be published for the
              Organizational Domain. That is a publishing recommendation, and
