                    SMTP is a surprisingly conversational protocol. Your server
                    doesn't just blast a message at the recipient — it has a
                    structured back-and-forth dialogue, like two people on a
                    phone call. The server introduces itself, the recipient
                    confirms it's listening, then they negotiate how to transfer
                    the message.

                    server processed it, and when. These headers stack in
                    reverse order: the top Received header is the last hop, and

                    This chain of Received headers is how you trace an email's
                    journey across the internet. It's also how receiving servers
                    detect suspicious routing — if an email claims to be from
                    Google but the Received chain shows it originated from an
                    unknown server in a different country, that's a red flag.

                    SMTP was designed in 1982 — before spam, before phishing,
                    before anyone imagined email would carry financial
                    transactions. The protocol has{" "}

                    . Any server can claim to be sending from any domain. It's
                    like a postal system where anyone can write any return
                    address on an envelope.

                    Three protocols were added later to fix this: SPF (2006),
                    DKIM (2007), and DMARC (2012). Together, they form the
                    authentication chain that modern email depends on. When the
                    recipient's server receives your message, it runs all three
                    checks before deciding whether to deliver, quarantine, or
                    reject.
