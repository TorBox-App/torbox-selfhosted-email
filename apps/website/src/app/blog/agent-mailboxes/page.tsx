              Sending email is not a reversible tool call
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Most of what an agent does can be undone. A bad file write gets
              reverted. A bad query gets re-run. A bad call against a staging
              environment gets forgotten by Monday. Email is not on that list.
              Once SES accepts a message it is gone &mdash; delivered, sitting
              in somebody else's mail store, and counted against your domain's
              reputation whether or not you meant to send it.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              So the question for anyone wiring an email tool into an agent is
              not whether the model will usually get it right. It is what
              happens the one time it doesn't.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The failure people picture is a hallucination. The more
              interesting one is prompt injection. Your agent reads a support
              ticket, a scraped page, a PDF someone attached &mdash; and the
              contents of that document become part of what it decides to do
              next. If the agent is holding a credential that can send mail to
              anyone, at any volume, as any verified identity in the account,
              then the authority of that document is the authority of the
              credential. One hallucination or one poisoned document away from
              forty thousand emails at 3am and a burned sending domain.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The uncomfortable part is that you can't fix this by asking the
              model to restrain itself. A rule in a system prompt lives in the
              same context window the attacker is writing into. A rule in a tool
              description lives there too. A rule in the MCP server's config
              lives on a machine the agent is already driving. Any check that
              runs inside the blast radius is not a check &mdash; it's a
              suggestion with good intentions.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The available options all fail in a specific way, and it's worth
              naming which. A raw SES key or IAM user is unbounded by
              construction: the ceiling is the account, and there is no
              per-agent anything. An ESP API key is worse for a different reason
              &mdash; you're sending on shared IPs, shared reputation is the
              provider's actual product, and autonomous traffic is a moderation
              problem they will eventually solve by clamping down on you.
              Agent-native mailbox providers give you the address but the same
              rented rails and the same exposure. And model-side guardrails, as
              above, are inside the thing you're trying to bound.
            </p>

            <p className="text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              What's missing is boring and structural: an agent with its own
              email identity, a credential scoped to that identity, and a policy
              enforced somewhere the agent cannot reach.

              Once the enforcer is in the path, everything depends on one
              question: when a request arrives, who is asking?
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The first implementation answered it the obvious way. The request
              body carried an{" "}
              <code className="rounded bg-muted px-1.5 py-0.5">agentId</code>,
              and the handler trusted it. An adversarial review blocked the
              release over exactly that, and it was right to. Every agent
              credential could invoke the same function ARN, so the id in the
              payload was a field the caller chose. Pass a sibling's id and you
              read that agent's policy, consume that agent's caps, and inherit
              that agent's allowlist and pinned sender. Kill an agent and it
              keeps sending by naming a live one. The kill switch was
              decoration.

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The fix is to stop asking the caller. Every agent gets its own

              , and its IAM policy is pinned to that qualified ARN. AWS then
              hands the enforcer an identity in a field the caller does not

              MCP schema (a one-element array or a bare string, nothing else),
              again by a defensive guard in the handler, and a third time by the
              enforcer, which re-validates the recipient shape across the repo
              boundary. The wire types are duplicated by hand into the MCP
              package with a source-of-truth header; the copy carries only the
              request and response shapes, not the server-side DynamoDB key
              builders. There is no CI check for drift between the two &mdash;
              today the protection is a comment, which is worth saying out loud.

              writing the record first would trade duplicate sends for lost

              agent" button &mdash; creation is CLI-only, and the empty state
              says so rather than hiding it.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The kill dialog is written to be accurate rather than reassuring:
              it flips the switch and syncs it to the enforcer, and if that sync
              fails you'll be told to retry. That isn't hedging. The Postgres
              write and the DynamoDB write can succeed independently, so the API
              returns a tri-state sync result and the UI shows an error toast,
              not a success, when the sync didn't land. A kill that's durable in
              Wraps and missing in your account is an agent that is still
              sending, and the only responsible thing to do is say so.

              The approval queue lists Send, Reason, Status and Actions, sorted
              by status priority rather than time so pending work is always on
              top. Only pending rows get buttons, and the buttons are Approve
              and Reject &mdash; there is no Block, because blocking already
              happened in your account before the row existed. The page loads
              once on mount, so an approval that arrives while the tab is open
              won't appear until you reload it.

              There are three subcommands. That's the whole surface:
            </p>

            <CodeBlock
              code={`Agent Commands:
  email agent create   Create a leashed agent mailbox
  email agent list     List agents
  email agent kill     Kill an agent (revoke sending)`}
              title="terminal"
            />

            <p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Approve and reject are deliberately not here &mdash; deciding a
              queued send is a dashboard and API action, not something an agent
              host should be able to shell out to.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Two prerequisites, both hard stops in the command rather than
              surprises later: email has to be initialized on the account, and
              the account has to be connected to the Wraps platform, because the
              approval-execute path needs the console access role to invoke the
              enforcer. Pass the agent name as a positional argument.
            </p>

            <CodeBlock
              code={`# upgrade the CLI
npm i -g @wraps.dev/cli@latest

# create an agent mailbox on a tracked domain
npx @wraps.dev/cli email agent create sdr --domain agents.foo.com

# see what exists
npx @wraps.dev/cli email agent list

# stop one
npx @wraps.dev/cli email agent kill sdr`}

            <p className="mt-4 mb-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Creation registers the agent with the platform, deploys the
              enforcer and the scoped credential, persists the stack outputs and
              syncs the policy &mdash; and only then prints the credential. That
              ordering is deliberate: if the process died after printing, the
              agent would be unrecoverable. What you get back is the block you
              paste into your MCP client config:
            </p>

            <p className="mt-4 text-foreground/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The CLI tells you to save the secret because it is shown only
              once. To be precise about what that means: it is shown once in the
              terminal. The key does live in your Pulumi state, so anyone who
              can read that stack can recover it. Treat the state file
              accordingly.
