    question: "How is this different from using AWS SES directly?",
    answer:
      "Two things. Setup: Wraps deploys all the infrastructure AWS SES needs (IAM roles, EventBridge, DynamoDB, Lambda, SQS) in one command instead of 2+ hours of manual work, and the TypeScript SDK is just `email.send()`. Then the part that lasts longer — running it. The dashboard is a control plane for the daily job: bounce and complaint rates drawn against the lines AWS reviews and pauses at, swept hourly; suppression you can browse and clear; deliverability and blacklist audits; every message searchable. SES gives you none of that on its own.",

The difference is what happens past the send API.
